Tip Tip jQuery Plugin (http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/tiptip-jquery-plugin)
Copyright 2010 Drew Wilson

This Plug-In will create a custom tooltip to replace the default
browser tooltip. It is extremely lightweight and very smart in

that it detects the edges of the browser window and will make sure

the tooltip stays within the current window size. As a result the

tooltip will adjust itself to be displayed above, below, to the left 
or to the right depending on what is necessary to stay within the

browser window. It is completely customizable as well via CSS.
